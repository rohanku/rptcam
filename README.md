This is a physically based, CPU-only rendering engine written in Rust. It uses path tracing to generate realistic images of 3D scenes.

## Features

- Simple declarative API, 100% Safe Rust
- Supports .OBJ, .MTL, and .STL file formats
- Uses unbiased path tracing for physically-based light transport
- Uses a microfacet BSDF model with multiple importance sampling
- Uses kd-trees to accelerate ray intersections
- Supports direct light sampling and emissive materials
- Supports HDRI environment maps
- Supports depth of field
- Supports iterative rendering, variance estimation, and firefly reduction
- Supports physics simulation with numerical integrators and particle systems
- Uses all CPU cores concurrently, scaling linearly up to 96 cores

## Quickstart

First, clone the repository. The library containing path tracing code is located inside `src/`. Example code and scenes are located in `examples/`. To compile and run `examples/basic.rs`, use the command:

```bash
cargo run --example basic
```

To run tests, use:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Library Usage

To use `rpt` as a library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpt = "0.2"
```

Here's a simple scene that demonstrates the basics of the API.

```rust
use rpt::*;

fn main() {
    let mut scene = Scene::new();

    scene.add(Object::new(sphere())); // default red material
    scene.add(
        Object::new(plane(glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0), -1.0))
            .material(Material::diffuse(hex_color(0xAAAAAA))),
    );
    scene.add(Light::Object(
        Object::new(
            sphere()
                .scale(&glm::vec3(2.0, 2.0, 2.0))
                .translate(&glm::vec3(0.0, 12.0, 0.0)),
        )
        .material(Material::light(hex_color(0xFFFFFF), 40.0)),
    ));

    let camera = Camera::look_at(
        glm::vec3(-2.5, 4.0, 6.5),
        glm::vec3(0.0, -0.25, 0.0),
        glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
        std::f64::consts::FRAC_PI_4,
    );

    Renderer::new(&scene, camera)
        .width(960)
        .height(540)
        .max_bounces(2)
        .num_samples(100)
        .render()
        .save("output.png")
        .unwrap();
}
```

This code can also be found in `examples/sphere.rs`. Note that the shadow is correctly tinted red due to [global illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination). See the detailed [API documentation](https://docs.rs/rpt) for information about all of the features, and feel free to learn from the other examples!
